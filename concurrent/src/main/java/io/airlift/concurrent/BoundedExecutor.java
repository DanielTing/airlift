/**
 * Guarantees that no more than maxThreads will be used to execute tasks submitted
 * through {@link #execute(Runnable) execute()}.
 * <p>
 * There are a few interesting properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Multiple BoundedExecutors over a single coreExecutor will have fair sharing
 * of the coreExecutor threads proportional to their relative maxThread counts, but
 * can use less if not as active.</li>
 * <li>Tasks submitted to a BoundedExecutor is guaranteed to have those tasks
 * handed to threads in that order.</li>
 * <li>Will not encounter starvation</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that each task submitted to this executor will still submit a trigger
 * task to the underlying executor. Thus, use of this class in conjunction
 * with an unbounded thread pool, such as one created by
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#newCachedThreadPool() newCachedThreadPool()},
 * will not prevent a spike in thread creations when many tasks are submitted
 * at once. Use {@link BoundedThreadPool} to provide a hard limit on thread creation.
